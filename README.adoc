== Description

This policy is to be used together with https://github.com/gr1d-io/gravitee-policy-keychain[Keychain Policy]. When used, the policy gets the data that has been retrieved by the Keychain Policy and applies it in an extra HTTP call for a provided URL that will return an Access Token that will be injected in the original HTTP call.
